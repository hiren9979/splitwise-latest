Expense History Balance Calculation Logic

1. When User A is viewing expense history with User B:

   For paidBy:
   - When User A paid (paidBy = User A): Amount is POSITIVE
   - This represents money that User A should receive from User B

   For owedBy:
   - When User A owes (owedBy = User A): Amount is NEGATIVE
   - This represents money that User A needs to pay to User B

2. Balance Calculation in SQL:
   ```sql
   SUM(CASE 
       WHEN ed.paidBy = UserA THEN ed.amount      -- User A paid (positive)
       WHEN ed.owedBy = UserA THEN -ed.amount     -- User A owes (negative)
   END) AS total
   ```

3. Examples:
   a) User A paid $100 for User B
      - Balance for User A: +$100 (User B owes User A)
      - Balance for User B: -$100 (User B needs to pay User A)

   b) User B paid $50 for User A
      - Balance for User A: -$50 (User A needs to pay User B)
      - Balance for User B: +$50 (User A owes User B)

4. Net Balance:
   - The final balance shown is the net sum of all transactions
   - Positive balance means the other user owes you money
   - Negative balance means you owe the other user money
